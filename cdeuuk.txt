China developing a taste for British teas and marmalade
Arriving at Tiptree Farm in the county of Essex in Southeast England, there's a scent of marmalade in the air.
"The factory is cooking oranges from Seville for marmalade," said He Tingting, China brand ambassador for the British jam maker.
One of He's roles is to give lectures about traditional British afternoon tea to businesses in China, such as hotels and restaurants.
She also hosts tour groups of Chinese visitors to Tiptree Farm.
He, who is from Shanghai, said traditional British food is gaining popularity in the East, especially with the younger generation who are willing to try new things.
"Cultural exchange is really strong and also in China the people are very curious and are open to trying new things," she said.
Strawberry jam, honey, and tomato ketchup are among the products that He has seen selling well in China.
"Chinese love berries. Strawberries, cherries, and raspberries are some of the new fruits that people there are starting to enjoy," she said. "It's not our typical fruit in China because of the climate. The varieties of strawberries may not necessarily be the same here, such as the little scarlet, it's a tiny berry with very in-depth flavor. It is something people are starting to discover in China."
The company also exports scones to China because scones made there do not taste right.
"Perhaps it's the flour or water that makes them taste different," she said.
He, an expert on British afternoon tea, said there is no right or wrong way to spread clotted cream or jam on scones. It is down to "personal preference". That is something she tells her Chinese customers.
The scones that are shipped to China by sea take about two months to arrive. He hopes they will soon be shipped by the new freight train that travels the length of the route through the countries covered by the Belt and Road Initiative.
"The challenge with scones is, they have to be on a frozen freight. It has to be constantly in the frozen temperature. ... We have our tested route to go to China which works well at the moment, but we are very excited to see the future potential of getting products over quicker, that's the real advantage," He said.
Wilkins and Sons, the company that makes the Tiptree Farm products, has its roots in 1885. It makes preserves, marmalade and condiments at Tiptree, as well as fruit gin liqueur, teas and fruit juices. The company grows much of its own fruits, including strawberries, mulberries, and rhubarb on the 405-hectare farm.
He believes the long British heritage along with the well-known brand and the traceability of its products is what attracts Chinese consumers.
"The products taste good, we use the best ingredients and, of course, we have had the royal warrant since 1911. So, it makes them wonder what do people here eat and what does the queen eat."
She said connecting with her Chinese clients is about finding a product that they can relate to.
"When I mention marmalade, a lot of people in China won't get a sense of what it is, but when I say it's like an orange peel to help seasickness and then they begin to understand because there's a similar snack in China that does the same thing," He said. "When I first started my job, I found the cultural differences interesting, but now I find there are a lot of similarities."
